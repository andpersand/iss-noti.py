# iss-noti.py
Just a little bot who tells you when the Internaional Space Station will next pass over a given set of coordinates.

## What it does

It uses the open-notify API to figure out when the ISS will next pass over the coordinates you give it.

## How to use it

To use the script, in terminal, navigate to the folder where you've saved it and enter:
`python3 iss-noti.py`

Right now, the script only accepts lattitude and longitude coordinates. All given times are in [UTC](https://time.is/UTC).
